# May 24rd - Finding Materials

I think I have all of the materials picked up and ready to go! I investigated for probably too much, but I've finally got them all decided! For screen, I will use [this one on Amazon](https://www.amazon.es/Waveshare-Module-Resolution-Electronic-Raspberry/dp/B071LGVVL1/), for the module (ESP32) I found [this one on AliExpress](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005004931357085.html), for the battery, [this one on AliExpress](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005006578220023.html) and, finally, for the NFC module, [this one](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005007182056113.html). Tomorrow I'll try to get them all together and build the 3D design :D

**Total time spent: 1.2h**

# May 23rd - Project Beginning

Just started with the project! I got this idea at random during the last night (happens a lot to me...), and thought "wow, this is cool". So today I started researching boards that are able to be programmed in JS and options for sharing the user's data card via NFC, and also made the logo (not very detailed, but it's ok for now) in figma :D

Also found out TFT displays are quite expensive... Yeah, I'll have to do more research on those on the coming days to find the perfect fit. Though, for the actual devices, I think I have some idea... I'm considering using [this board](https://shop.espruino.com/mdbt42q-breakout), but tomorrow I'll see how hard is to integrate the nfc antenna to it, as it does not come preinstalled.
